# QbreaderFrequencyList
A Messy Parser for Shifting Through Answerlines:  https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=27317

This was done as a request to turn qbreader answer lines (separated by line, see link for source). It's definitely not perfect; "Bohr" and "Neils Bohr" will be sorted separately, for example. However, it's generally pretty good at doing what it's supposed to do.
